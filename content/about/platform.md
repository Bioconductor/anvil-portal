# About AnVIL

The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) is a scalable and interoperable resource for the genomic scientific community, that leverages a cloud-based infrastructure for democratizing genomic data access, sharing and computing across large genomic, and genomic-related data sets.

The AnVIL facilitates integration and computing on and across large datasets generated by NHGRI programs, as well as initiatives funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH), or by other agencies that support human genomics research. In addition, the AnVIL is a component of the emerging federated data ecosystem and is expected to collaborate and integrate with other genomic data resources through the adoption of the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, as their specifications emerge from the scientific community.
 
 AnVIL provides a collaborative environment, where datasets and analysis workflows can be shared within a consortium and be prepared for public release to the broad scientific community through AnVIL user interfaces. The AnVIL will be tailored for users that have limited computational expertise as well as sophisticated data scientist users.

Specifically, the AnVIL resource will provide genomic researchers with the following key elements: 

Cloud-based infrastructure and software platform
Shared analysis and computing environment 
Interoperability and compliance with the emerging federated data ecosystem
Cloud services cost control 
Genomic datasets, phenotypes and metadata 
Data access and data security 
User training and outreach 
Incorporation of scientific and technology advance for storing, accessing, sharing and computing on large genomic datasets
