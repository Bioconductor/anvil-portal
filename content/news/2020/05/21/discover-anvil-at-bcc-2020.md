# No Face Mask Required! Discover AnVIL Virtually at the Online, Global BCC 2020
##### Posted: May 21, 2020

The 2020 Bioinformatics Community Conference will be held online.  This will allow BCC to greatly lower  [registration rates](https://bcc2020.github.io/Registration) to a fraction of their original cost, and to also include a discount for students and researchers from the developing world.

In addition, BCC2020 is [going global](https://bcc2020.github.io/blog/going-global),  BCC2020 events will be held twice: once in their original Toronto time zone (BCC West), and again 12 hours later in the Eastern hemisphere (BCC East).


It is hoped that these two changes will make BCC2020 accessible to the entire world.

## AnVIL @ BCC 2020
AnVIL team members will be presenting the following virtual training workshops. See the individual event pages for details on dates, times and registration information.

### Dockstore Fundamentals: Introduction to Docker and Descriptors for Reproducible Analysis
A [hands-on workshop](/events/bcc2020-dockstore-fundamentals) to train a beginner on the fundamental technologies used to create portable and reproducible workflows.

### R / Bioconductor in the Cloud
This session introduces R / Bioconductor in the AnVIL cloud computing environment. We cover use of the cloud as a replacement to desktop-style computing.

### Reproducible Analysis in the Cloud with Dockstore and Terra
This session will lead users through the steps of performing reproducible genomic analysis at scale in the cloud with Dockstore and Terra.
