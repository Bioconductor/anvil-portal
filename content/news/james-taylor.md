April 3, 2020

We regret to share that James Taylor passed away in April of 2020. His full obituary can be found on the [Galaxy Community Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/).
 
 A trailblazer in computational biology and genomics research, Taylor made an impact as a scientist, teacher, and colleague, with appointments at the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
  
  James helped develop the Galaxy platform for data analysis and worked with members of his lab to extend the platform to make large scale computational analysis more accessible and reproducible.

James was a member of the Science Gateways Institute Steering Committee, and had been a member of the National Center for Genome Analysis Scientific Advisory Board from 2014 to 2016; a member of the iPlant Scientific Advisory Board from 2013 to 2016; a member of the XSEDE Project User Advisory Committee from 2012 to 2014; and co-chair of the International Arabadopsis Informatics Consortium: Engineering, Architecture and Infrastructure Working Group in 2011.
