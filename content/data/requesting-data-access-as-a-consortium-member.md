#Requesting Data Access as a Consortium Member

<hero small>AnVIL helps consortia fulfil their data sharaing agreements by ... </hero>



Many consortia have data sharing agreements between members granting each member access to every other member's data within the consortium.


The AnVIL is offering a streamlined access process for consortium members in Data-Sharing Consortia.

## Consortia Access Control Admin
 
The Consortium bringing the data in designates a contact person, and that person is added to an access list as an access control admin for the consortia's datasets. 
 
The admin can add or remove users as their needs demand, and any users added to that list will see all the workspaces for their group.
 
 For example, someone added to the CCDG access list will be able to see all the CCDG workspaces.
 
> Note that a few cohorts are excluded from the consortium-wide-access due to data sensitivity needs.
