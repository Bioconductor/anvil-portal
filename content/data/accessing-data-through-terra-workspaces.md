## Accessing Data through Terra Workspaces

In general during data ingest, each consortia's studies are divided into data sets by study id, consent group and submitting lab. 


To request access as a non consortia member:

1. [Create an account](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) in AnVIL Terra and link your eRA Commons / NIH account.
1. Request access to the study in using dbGaPs [Authorized Access Portal](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) with the study's phsId. See NCBI's [Starting Point to Applying for dbGaP Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99225/) for more information.
1. Once your access is approved, your data will appear as one or more workspaces in your Terra account.  

Please see the [Requesting Data Access](/data/requesting-data-access) and [Once Your Access is Granted](/data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted) guides for more detai
