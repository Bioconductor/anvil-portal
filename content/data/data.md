# Data Sets

<hero small>AnVIL hosts high value genomic datasets relevant to human health and disease.</hero>

AnVIL data sets include NHGRI funded data sets of the Centers for Commons Disease Genetics (CCDG), the Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), and the Genotype Tissue-Expression project (GTEx). Additional data sets include the high coverage 1000 Genomes whole genome sequencing data and VCFs, with more data sets to be added over time.
 
 Users can also upload their own data to AnVIL and utilize access controlled sharing mechanisms to manage and control access within secure environments. These access controls can also be leveraged to protect pre-release datasets while collaborators work in the cloud.
