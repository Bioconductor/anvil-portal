## Accessing AnVIL Data via Pre-Built Terra Workspaces

In the near future, AnVIL data will be accessed through Terra workspaces created from cohorts defined in AnVIL's [Gen3](https://gen3.org/) instance. While Gen3 is being brought online, data can be accessed through the pre-built Terra workspaces listed below. 

To access data:

1. [Create an account](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) in AnVIL Terra and link your eRA Commons / NIH account.
1. Request access to the study in using dbGaPs [Authorized Access Portal](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) with the study's phsId. See NCBI's [Starting Point to Applying for dbGaP Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99225/) for more information.
1. Once your access is approved, your data will appear as one or more workspaces in your Terra account.  

Please see the [Requesting Data Access](/data/requesting-data-access) and [Accessing Data in Terra](/data/requesting-data-access#accessing-data-in-terra) guides for more detai.
