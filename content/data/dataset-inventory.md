# Dataset Inventory

<hero small>Currently, AnVIL data can be accessed through the Terra workspaces listed below. In the near future, the [Gen3 Data Explorer](https://gen3.org/) will allow for selection of datasets and the creation of virtual cohorts that can then be analyzed in a users personal or shared Terra workspace.</hero>

## Accessing AnVIL Data via Terra Workspaces

In general during data ingest, each consortia's studies are divided into data sets by study id, consent group and submitting lab. 

To access data:

1. [Create an account](https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces) in AnVIL Terra and link your eRA Commons / NIH account.
1. Request access to the study in using dbGaPs [Authorized Access Portal](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login) with the study's phsId. See NCBI's [Starting Point to Applying for dbGaP Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK99225/) for more information.
1. Once your access is approved, your data will appear as one or more workspaces in your Terra account.  

Please see the [Requesting Data Access](/data/requesting-data-access) and [Once Your Access is Granted](/data/requesting-data-access#once-your-access-is-granted) guides for more detai.

## Workspaces Currently Accessible by Consortia Members Only

### Coming Soon - dbGaP Study Registration in Progress

> For workspaces with no dbGaP Id, the dbGaP study registration is in progress. The dbGap Ids will be displayed once assigned by dbGaP. 

>For workspaces where the dbGaP Id is not selectable, the dbGaP study registration is in progress.  The dbGaP Id has been assigned but the study is not yet listed in dbGaP.
