#Data Submission
##How do I submit data to AnVIL for sharing with the scientific community?
If you have questions about submitting your data to AnVIL please contact the AnVIL team (<help@lists.anvilproject.org>) or complete our onboarding [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3NViQ8bTkXexqJ7QukcIcSwe1OLlIirScvaP7YXq4TMqa7A/viewform).

##Does NHGRI plan to move data from dbGaP to AnVIL?
Yes. NHGRI plans to transfer data from selected NHGRI-funded studies to the AnVIL platform. Before this happens, Institutions and the study PIs will be notified of the plan to transfer data and will have an opportunity to consult with IRBs and notify the NHGRI if there are substantive concerns.

##What do I need to do if I have data from a study that was explicitly consented for dbGaP but wish to deposit data in AnVIL?
Please discuss this situation with your IRB, the NIH program director for your study and the AnVIL staff. In most cases, the submitting institution will determine whether data may be submitted to AnVIL.

##How should I prepare my informed consent documents to allow for data submission to AnVIL in the future?
Rather than naming a particular data repository (i.e., dbGaP, AnVIL, etc.) as the data repository for your study, consider indicating that data will be deposited in an ‘NIH-designated data repository’ (see the [Informed Consent Resource, Special Considerations for Genome Research](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues/Informed-Consent-for-Genomics-Research/Special-Considerations-for-Genome-Research#6) for more detailed sample language). This will provide the flexibility to submit to dbGAP, AnVIL, or any other new and relevant NIH-designated repository.
