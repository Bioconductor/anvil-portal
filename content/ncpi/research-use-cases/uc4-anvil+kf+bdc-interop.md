**Researchers**: Any investigator that can leverage other datasets as controls for analysis, has been mentioned by a number of Kids First X01 investigators. For example, TOPMed and/or GTEx could be good controls for Kids First studies, mentioned most recently by Ali Gharavi (Columbia), studying structural defects of kidney and urinary tract. Unaffected family members or germline from cancer cohorts in Kids First could be good controls for other studies.

### Analysis Question

Appropriate controls are needed for various case/control analysis, such as burden testing. Ideally this is a healthy population with similar ancestry, but cohorts without the phenotype/disease of interest are often reasonable substitutes.

### Analysis Plan

1. Obtain confirmation from appropriate NIH Data Access Committees (e.g., Kids First ) that these datasets can be used/combined in this manner.
1. Identify studies/participants with appropriate exclusion criteria that have the appropriate consent to be used as controls.
1. Determine the pipeline used to call the variants to make sure theyâ€™re co-analyzable.
    1. If not, run appropriate pipelines.
