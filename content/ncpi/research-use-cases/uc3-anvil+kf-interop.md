# UC3 - NHGRI AnVIL + Kids First DRC

### Analysis Question

We are analyzing genomic data from patients with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Our goal is to identify novel candidate genes as well as compare the diagnostic utility of the AUDIOMEâ€”a two-tiered, exome-based test including targeted analysis of 123 known hearing loss genes to whole-exome analysis. We would like to identify all participants with hearing loss across the datasets to combine with data we have generated to increase our power. We are aware of cases in the Kids First datasets as well as in the PediSeq (part of CSER), but anticipate more cases are available, especially in AnVIL datasets. We would like to expand this analysis to whole genome data, if available, as it will help us explore regulatory regions, copy number variants and structural variants. In the future, understanding hearing loss in the context of syndromic disorders could be of interest, including our Cornelia de Lange syndrome cohort currently undergoing sequencing as part of Kids First.

### Analysis Plan

1. Obtain confirmation from appropriate NIH Data Access Committees (e.g., Kids First ) that these datasets can be used/combined in this manner.
1. Identify all cases with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss across all platforms
1. For exome data, utilize in the cloud platforms ExomeDepth and XHMM to analyze rare CNVs as well as using GEMINI to evaluate the SNV burden per gene, in our cohort as compared to unaffected controls.
