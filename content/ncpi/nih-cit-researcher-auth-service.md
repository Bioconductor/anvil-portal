#NIH CIT Researcher Auth Service



<hero small>The NIH CIT is working to create one unified Researcher Auth Service (RAS) that will streamline access to multiple NIH data resources.</hero> 


Currently all of these platforms use different methods of logging in and managing approvals to controlled access data, and this is one of the major roadblocks to interoperability.
 
 
This group is making good progress and they plan to deploy components of the service for systems that enable single sign on and modernized communication of dbGaP approval information this summer.
