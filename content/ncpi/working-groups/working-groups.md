<hero>We are collecting specific research use cases in this section that can drive our proof of concept in 6 months.</hero>

## Working Groups
Over the last 6 months, the group established working groups to address various layers of interoperability;

These include:

* **Community Governance**:  for addressing operational barriers to trans-platform data sharing,

* **FHIR** for piloting FHIR standards for modeling and exchanging clinical and phenotypic data,

* **Outreach**: for coordinating training resources for transitioning researchers to the cloud,

* **Systems Interoperation**: for testing technical standards for exchanging data across platforms and

* **NIH CIT Researcher Auth Service (RAS)**:  for streamlining access to multiple NIH data resources.





While the working groups are making  progress on these critical first steps to achieving interoperability, additional activities will be needed (e.g. data harmonization).
