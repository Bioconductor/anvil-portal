# About the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort (NCPI)


## Overview

The NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort (NCPI) was created as an outcome of the NIH Workshop on Cloud-Based Platforms Interoperability held at RENCI on October 3-4th, 2019.
 
 The mission of the NCPI is to drive interoperability among the genomic analysis platforms established by the NCI, NHLBI, NHGRI and the NIH Common Fund.
 
This new interoperability effort is a collaboration between NIH representatives, team members from each platform and researchers running driver projects to validate the interoperability approaches.
 
 <hero small>The NCPI will establish and implement guidelines and technical standards to empower end-user analyses across participating platforms and facilitate the realization of a trans-NIH, federated data ecosystem.</hero>

 The NCPI will demonstrate progress based on realistic researcher use cases every six months.


## Participating Platforms

The NCPI will work to enable analysis across the following data commons:

* NHGRI [AnVIL](/ncpi/platforms#analysis-visualization-and-informatics-lab-space-anvil),
* NHLBI [BioData Catalyst](/ncpi/platforms#cancer-research-data-commons-crdc),
* NIH Common Fund's [Gabriella Miller Kids First](/ncpi/platforms#kids-first-data-resource-center) Pediatric Research Program,
* and the NCI [Cancer Research Data Commons](/ncpi/platforms#cancer-research-data-commons-crdc).

## Areas of Focus

The NCPI has intentionally constrained the problems we are addressing to that which are achievable in the near term and maximize demonstrable value to researchers by enabling specific research use cases.
 
The NCPI's working groups and collaborating projects along with their areas of focus are listed below.


1. [Community Governance Working Group](/ncpi/working-groups#community-governance-working-group) - Establish a set of [principles](/ncpi/interoperating-principles) for promoting interoperability across multiple platforms to remove operational barriers to trans-platform data sharing.

1. [Coordination Working Group](/ncpi/working-groups#coordination-working-group) - Coordinate discourse, collaboration, and meetings between the working groups of NCPI.

1. [FHIR Working Group](/ncpi/working-groups#fhir-working-group) - Assess the potential of FHIR resources to model and share complex clinical and phenotypic data.

1. [NIH CIT  Researcher Auth Service (RAS) Project](ncpi/working-groups#nih-cit-researcher-auth-service-project) - Streamline access to multiple NIH data resources by enabling single sign-on and modernized communication of dbGaP approval information.

1. [Outreach and Training Working Group](/ncpi/working-groups#outreach-and-training-working-group) - Create a public knowledge base with training materials and a cloud cost guide to educate researchers on the research use cases enabled by interoperable cloud based data commons. 

1. [Systems Interoperation Working Group](ncpi/working-groups#nih-systems-interoperation-working-group) - Test and implement technical standards (e.g. GA4GH APIs)  for data exchange and demonstrate their effectiveness by enabling key cross-platform research use cases. 


## Driving Research Use Cases

 The interoperability effort is being driven by  key use cases that our research community has identified.
 
 1. [BioData Catalyst + Kids First DRC](/ncpi/research-use-cases#1---nhlbi-biodata-catalyst--kids-first-drc) - Develop a more accurate pipeline to detect de novo mutations in family trios by utilizing the consistent calls and other graph-related information produced by the SBG graph tools in the PCGC pipeline.
 
 1. [BioData Catalyst + Kids First DRC](/ncpi/research-use-cases#2---nhlbi-biodata-catalyst--kids-first-drc) -  Help the scientific community to better understand cardiogenesis and to better assess risk of disease. Access to this whole genome sequence data will facilitate our work
 
 1. [BioData Catalyst + Kids First DRC](/ncpi/research-use-cases#3---nhlbi-biodata-catalyst--kids-first-drc) - A comparison of cardiac-associated genes from BioData Catalyst's TOPMed Vanderbilt atrial fibrillation and Kids First congenital heart defects cohorts.

 1. [AnVIL + Kids First DRC + NHLBI BioData Catalyst](/ncpi/research-use-cases#4---nhgri-anvil--kids-first-drc--nhlbi-biodata-catalyst) - Leveraging cross platform datasets as controls for analysis.
 
 1. [CRDC +  AnVIL](/ncpi/research-use-cases#5----nci-crdc--nhgri-anvil) - Find a path to connect the GTEx data on the AnVIL platform to further processing and also combination with a prior analysis on the CRDC. This “normals” use case is a frequent request from our users, so finding a solution would be extremely valuable for a large number of cancer researchers
 
 1. [CRDC +  AnVIL](/ncpi/research-use-cases#6-nci-crdc--nhgri-anvil) - A comparison of transcriptome variation between tumors derived from male and female cancer patients.


## Progress Updates

The NCPI will give progress updates every six months. Summaries of past progress updates are listed below:
