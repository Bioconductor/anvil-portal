# About NCPI - the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort

<hero small>The NCPI effort's mission is to establish guidelines and technical standards that will empower end-user analyses across the NIH's genomic analysis platforms.</hero>


## Overview

The NCPI effort is a collaborative effort between: 

* NHGRI AnVIL,
* NHLBI BioData Catalyst,
* NIH Common Fund's Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program,
* and the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons. 

The goal of this collaboration to enable and promote end-user analyses of human genomic and phenotypic datasets across these platforms through federation and interoperability.
 

## Data Commons Interoperability
The above systems are all examples of data commons.
By a data commons we mean a software platform that co-locates: 1) data, 2) cloud-based computing infrastructure, and 3) commonly used software applications, tools and services to create a resource for managing, harmonizing, analyzing and sharing data with a scientific community 



**Data Portals** allow researchers to query across data they make available to the community.  Examples include the Kids First Data Resource Center Portal (https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org), the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Portal (https://gdc.cancer.gov), and the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org).

A **Workspace Environment** is one where users can take links to data files (genomic, clinical, phenotypic, etc) along with analytical tools and put them together, performing analysis at scale through a simple web interface.  Examples include Terra, Seven Bridges Genomics, DNAstack, DNAnexus, and Galaxy.

**Data Storage**

**Workflows**

Each of these platforms above are made up of:

1. portals for finding and aggregating data,
1. cloud based analysis workspaces,
1. collections of analytical workflows and tools,  and
1. cloud-based data storage repositories (in either AWS or Google),

## Interop Technical Use Cases

Authenticate across platforms and platform components -

Authorization across platforms and platform componets - managing approvals

Search for data across plaforms - 

Export data from one plaform to another - 

Harmonize data across platforms and datasets -

Harmonize phenotypic data across platforms and datasets -

Harmonize clinical data across platforms and datasets -

Export an analysis program or workflow  from one platform to another -

Export analysis results from one platform to another -

Run cross platform workflows - 

## Interop Research Use Cases

 This new interoperability effort is being driven by additional key use cases that our research community has identified.
