# About NCPI - the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability Effort


A key aim of the NIH is to strengthen the genomics analysis infrastructure by fostering the development of multiple cloud based, interoperable, genomic data commons and to deploy these data commons as a federated data ecosystem

To help achieve this aim, members from the following cloud based genomic analysis platforms have recently joined together to launch the NIH Cloud Platform Interoperability (NCPI) effort:


* NHGRI AnVIL,
* NHLBI BioData Catalyst,
* NIH Common Fund's Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program,
* and the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons.


The NCPI is working to establish guidelines and technical standards that will empower end-user analyses across the NIH's genomic analysis platforms and enable the realization of the federated data ecosystem.

## Data Commons

Each of the systems listed above can be classified as “Genomic Data Commons” as they collocate data, cloud computing infrastructure and commonly used tools & applications for managing, integrating, analyzing and sharing data that are exposed through APIs to create an interoperable resource. [1]

### Components of a Data Commons


**Data Portals** allow researchers to query across data they make available to the community.  Examples include the Kids First Data Resource Center Portal (https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org), the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) Portal (https://gdc.cancer.gov), and the GTEx Portal (https://gtexportal.org).

A **Workspace Environment** is one where users can take links to data files (genomic, clinical, phenotypic, etc) along with analytical tools and put them together, performing analysis at scale through a simple web interface.  Examples include Terra, Seven Bridges Genomics, DNAstack, DNAnexus, and Galaxy.

**Data Storage**

**Workflows**

Each of these platforms above are made up of:

1. portals for finding and aggregating data,
1. cloud based analysis workspaces,
1. collections of analytical workflows and tools,  and
1. cloud-based data storage repositories (in either AWS or Google),



## Interop Technical Use Cases

Authenticate across platforms and platform components -

Authorization across platforms and platform componets - managing approvals

Search for data across plaforms - 

Export data from one plaform to another - 

Harmonize data across platforms and datasets -

Harmonize phenotypic data across platforms and datasets -

Harmonize clinical data across platforms and datasets -

Export an analysis program or workflow  from one platform to another -

Export analysis results from one platform to another -

Run cross platform workflows - 

## Interop Research Use Cases

 This new interoperability effort is being driven by additional key use cases that our research community has identified.
