**Data Repository Service V1.1** - TThe Data Repository Service (DRS) API provides a generic interface to data repositories so data consumers, including workflow systems, can access data objects in a single, standard way regardless of where they are stored and how they are managed. The primary functionality of DRS is to map a logical ID to a means for physically retrieving the data represented by the ID.

[**Apache Avro**](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/index.html)  Avro is a data serialization system.

Avro provides:

* Rich data structures.
* A compact, fast, binary data format.
* A container file, to store persistent data.
* Remote procedure call (RPC).
* Simple integration with dynamic languages. Code generation is not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols. Code generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically typed languages.
